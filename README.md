# Hotel-Booking-Cancellations-Capstone
Train and Select Best ML Model (TreeClassifier, kNN, NaiveBayes) for Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations

The data set that we will be using contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. We will use this single data set and try make a prediction by using different algorithms with the goal of deciding which one performs the best.The aim is to create meaningful estimators from the data set we have and to select the model that predicts the cancellation best by comparing them with the accuracy scores of different machine learning models.
